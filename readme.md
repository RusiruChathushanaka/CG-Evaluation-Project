## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/evaluation-project.git
    cd evaluation-project
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

This section describes how to run the different components of the project.

### Data Processing

To process the raw data, run the `data_processing.py` script:

```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```

This script will clean, transform, and prepare the data for model training.

### Model Training

To train the model, execute the `model_training.py` script:

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

This script will train the model using the processed data and save the trained model.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the trained model, run the `evaluation.py` script:

```bash
python src/evaluation.py
```

This script will generate performance metrics and visualizations.
